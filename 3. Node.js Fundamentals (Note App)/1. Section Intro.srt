Hello and welcome to Section 3 node fundamentals in this section you're going to be learning a ton about

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,780
building node applications and you're going to actually build your first one a note application.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,000
This is where all the really fun stuff is going to start.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,510
We're going to kick things off by learning about all of the modules that come built into node.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,130
These are objects and functions and let you do stuff with javascript.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,840
You've never been able to do before.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,860
We're going to learn how to do things like read and write from the file system which we'll be using

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,460
in the Notes application to persist our data.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,960
Now we're also going to be looking at third party NPM modules.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,400
This is a big part of the reason that node became so popular.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,180
NPM gives you a great collection of third party libraries you can use and they'll solve really common

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,490
problems so you don't have to rewrite that boilerplate code over and over again.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,800
We're going to be using a third party module in this section to help with fetching input from that user.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,180
Now aside from all of that we're going to be looking at debugging broken apps.

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,620
We'll look at some new iOS 6 features.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,020
It's all coming up now but we're going to kick things off talking about something called require
