This brings us to the end of our asynchronous node section but that does not mean you have to stop building

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,420
out the weather app.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,050
Students love adding new features.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,830
They've said they've learned a lot doing it so I'm going to give you a couple of ideas as to what you

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,040
could do to continue on with this project.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,510
First up you could load in more information.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,730
The response we get back from the weather API contains a ton of stuff besides just the current temperature

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,840
which is what we use.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,180
I like to incorporate some of that stuff in there.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,780
Whether it's high low temperatures or chance of precipitation.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,420
Next up would be really cool to have a default location ability.

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,360
There would be a command that lets me set a default location and then I could run the weather map with

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,850
no location argument to use that default.

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,160
I could always specify a location argument to search for whether somewhere else this would be an awesome

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,650
feature and it would work kind of similar to the Notes app where we save data to the file system.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,620
If you do end up implementing any of these posts in the Q&A send a link to the project.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,750
I would love to see what you built.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,570
That's all for now.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,510
I'll see you in the next section.
