00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,210
Hello and welcome to section for a asynchronous node.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,020
Yes.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,910
Now if you've read just one article about Noad you probably come across four terms a synchronous nonblocking

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,240
event based and single threaded.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,390
All of those are accurate terms to describe node.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,370
The problem is it usually stops there.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,800
It's really abstract.

8
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,870
The goal in this section is to make that super practical by putting it all to use in our weather application.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,240
That's the project we're going to be building in this section and to get it done.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,570
We're going to need to make asynchronous HTP requests.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,000
We're going to want to fetch from two API.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:43,160
We'll be using Google's geo location API and we'll be using the dark sky API to take location information

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,970
like a zip code and turn that into real world current weather information.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,910
Now in order to do all that we're going to look at callbacks promises HTP requests and more.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,360
Let's go ahead and dive right in looking at the very basics of async programming in node
